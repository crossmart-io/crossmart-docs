title: Roles and permissions
description: The permissions each built-in role grants to members and API keys, the rules around roles, and custom roles.
---

Every member and every API key in a workspace has a role. A role is a set of permissions, and
each route requires one permission. Callers that are not in the workspace get `404`, so workspace
ids don't leak. Callers in the workspace that lack the permission get
`403 Requires the <permission> permission`.

`GET /api/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}` returns the caller's `permissions`, and so does
`GET /api/v1/api-key` for an API key. Clients should check those, not the role name, so they keep
working when roles change.

## Rules around roles

- A member or API key can only grant, change or remove roles that its own role covers, meaning it
  holds every permission of that role. An Admin can't touch an Owner or make one.
- A workspace always keeps at least one Owner. Members can't leave their only workspace.
- API keys can't be Owners. A key never has more access than its creator. Revoking a key needs
  the same: the revoker must have every permission the key has, unless they created it. Keys are
  revoked when their creator is removed, and on a demotion when the new role couldn't have created
  them.

## Custom roles

Besides the five built-in roles, a workspace can define its own roles under
`/api/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/roles`. Listing it returns both the built-in roles, with their
permissions, and the custom ones. Members, invitations and API keys hold one as
`role: CUSTOM` plus `customRoleId`. The database refuses one without the other.

- Creating, changing and deleting roles needs `members:manage`. Anyone with `members:view` can
  list them.
- A role never holds more than the person defining or editing it has, and never
  `workspace:delete`. `workspace:view` is always added so its holders can open the workspace.
- A change applies to everyone holding the role right away. API keys created by its members that
  now allow more than the role are revoked. Keys that hold the role itself just narrow with it.
- A role still held by a member, a pending invitation or an active API key can't be deleted.
- A role that's somehow gone grants nothing.
